# read as "the modes leave these outside the tunnel", it invites someone to
# align the list generator with this table and silently change what the default
# tunnels. The contents are POLICY rather than mechanics, so the grounds are
# named: private networks (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16) and CGNAT (100.64/10)
# live at the ISP and on the home network; 0/8, 127/8 and 169.254/16 are not
# routed; 192.0.0/24 is IETF protocol assignments, 192.0.2/24, 198.51.100/24 and
# 203.0.113/24 are documentation examples, 198.18/15 is benchmarking; 224/3 is
# multicast, reserved space and the broadcast address. None of these is a place

# awg_installed_protocol : the INSTALLATION's generation, from the AWG_PROTOCOL
# marker in awgsetup_cfg.init (already loaded by safe_load_config). Prints '2.0'
# or '3.1'.
# 🔴 A missing field IS 2.0, not "unknown": that is what every install made
# before the marker existed looks like, and any other answer could silently
# change its generation. Any other value is a failure (code 1) with NO output
# and no quiet default: a corrupt marker on a third-line server would otherwise
# (once regen consults the marker) make regen hand out second-line profiles that
# silently fail to connect. The
# caller prints the error text: the function body is identical in all four
# copies (RU/EN, shared library/installer), and the parity test checks that.
# Optional argument: path to the init file. With it the file is checked
# fail-closed by one anchored grep without a pipeline (a pipeline under pipefail
# took SIGPIPE on a large file and switched the guard off): a line of the form
# "AWG_PROTOCOL =" in any case with an empty value (the field did not parse:
# indentation, spaces around '=', broken quotes; or it was written empty) is a
# corrupt marker, not a missing one; two or more such lines are corrupt too
# (which one is true cannot be guessed). Both fail, or a corrupt marker would
# quietly read as 2.0.
# 🔴 The pattern allows a leading BOM ON PURPOSE: safe_load_config parses such a
# line, so the guard has to see it too. Without that, a corrupt marker behind a
# BOM (a file that went through a Windows editor) did not match the pattern, the
# guard read the marker as absent and answered 2.0 - exactly the silent
# substitution it is written against. For the same reason a second marker line
# did not match when the first carried a BOM, so a duplicate passed as a single
# marker.
# 🔴 grep's exit codes are not interchangeable: 1 means no match (normal), 2 and
# above mean grep itself failed (unreadable file, a directory in place of a
# file). The former '|| n=0' form equated them and turned a failure into "no
# marker", that is, into a confident 2.0. A read error now refuses as well.

# Warn when awgsetup_cfg.init disagrees with the live awg0.conf (issue #196).

# After the install, awg0.conf is the only source of the obfuscation parameters,
# and the init file is read for them only during the bootstrap of a first
# install (see load_awg_params above). Editing AWG_* in the init file afterwards
# has no effect on clients, and until this check it was ignored SILENTLY: the
# file is named like the installation config, so someone edits it and gets no
# hint that the answer lives elsewhere.
#
# The modification-time gate removes false positives on the supported path.
# The recommended way to tune (edit [Interface] in awg0.conf, then regen) also
# makes the two files disagree, but nothing rewrites the init file after the
# install, so there it stays OLDER than the live config. We warn only when the
# init file was touched LATER than awg0.conf, which is the "edited init, nothing
# happened" case.
#
# Deliberately not hooked into load_awg_params: the installer calls that on
# step 6, where the init file is necessarily newer than an awg0.conf that has
# not been rewritten yet, and the warning would surface mid-install.

# Normalise a comma-separated list to the canonical "a, b, c" form.
#
# Why: the installer writes AllowedIPs and DNS with a space after each comma,
# while regenerate_client read those values through `tr -d '[:space:]'` and
# wrote what it had read straight back, so the very first regen left a
# collapsed list in .conf (D#38 @humowns). Here the list is split per element
# and the separator is rebuilt canonically, so a repeated regen REPAIRS configs
# that were already damaged.
#
# 🔴 Do NOT apply this to the value that feeds the allowed_ips JSON array in the
# vpn:// builder (see the comment at generate_vpn_uri): that one needs the
# COMPACT form. One revision of this very fix did normalise it there, and on a
# test server that put a leading space inside 33 of the 34 array elements.
#
# Whitespace is stripped INSIDE each element, not only at its edges: elements of
# these two lists (CIDRs and resolver addresses) never contain spaces, and the
# `manage modify` validator cleans them the same way, via `${tok//[[:space:]]/}`.
# That also repairs values like "1.1.1. 1", which the old `tr` cleaned by luck.
#
# Split via `read -a` rather than `for x in $raw` so the value is not subject to
# glob expansion. The trim is inline rather than a function call: a substitution
# per element forks a subshell, and on a 2000-entry list that is 18 seconds
# against 0.1 - while regen without a name walks every client at once.
#

# awg_cps_decoded_size <I string> [...] : total DECODED size in bytes.
#
# Why. The I1-I5 parameters land in the device attributes that the kernel emits
# as a single netlink dump message. Once the device attributes fill most of the
# buffer, the first peer no longer fits, and `wg_get_device_dump` neither
# advances nor fails: it returns a non-zero length, netlink asks again, and the
# same message is produced forever. The reader spins and grows; on a router that
# is enough to take the box down. Written up with the code path in
# amneziawg-linux-kernel-module#228 (31 aug 2026); the user-visible symptom is
# #148. The band just above the looping one answers `Unable to access interface:
# Message too long`, which is BETTER: an error at least stops. Those are the
# exact words: errno EMSGSIZE, which glibc renders as "too long", so that is
# what to grep a log for.
#
# 🔴 The DECODED size is counted, not the string length. `<r 1000>` is eight
# characters and a thousand bytes on the wire; comparing string lengths would
# miss exactly the case this check exists for.
#
# The tag set is the intersection of both implementations, which is also the set
# the vendor documents: `<b 0xHEX>` literal bytes, `<r N>` random bytes,
# `<rc N>` random letters, `<rd N>` random digits, `<t>` a timestamp (4 bytes).
# `<c>` counts as the same 4 bytes: it exists in the kernel module and not in
# amneziawg-go, so it affects portability rather than size.
# Nothing unknown is guessed at: an invented number is worse than an honest
# refusal. But it must not pass in silence either, so anything left unparsed -
# an unknown tag, an unterminated bracket, junk between tags, an implausibly
# large count - marks the result with exit code 2, "the sum is an under-count".
# A zero with code 0 must mean "parsed everything, there is no size", otherwise
# the caller reads junk as emptiness.

# LOCKING CONTRACT: the caller MUST hold an exclusive flock on
# ${AWG_DIR}/.awg_config.lock when invoking this function. The lock is
# acquired by generate_client() — the only current caller. Do not call
# add_peer_to_server directly without holding the lock.
#
# Why an inner flock is not possible here: bash flock is not re-entrant
# across different file descriptors on the same file. generate_client()
# opens .awg_config.lock on its own fd and holds an exclusive lock; an
# attempt to open the same file on a new fd inside add_peer_to_server
# and take an exclusive lock there would self-deadlock (the parent lock
# is seen as foreign). Contract-based locking is the only reliable
# option in this situation. Re-entrant behaviour is possible only if
# the sub-function uses the SAME fd as the parent (via inheritance),
# which would require passing the fd as an argument.
